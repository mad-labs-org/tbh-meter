# Log event detection (by klass-pointer, not by ELogType)

`LogManager` keeps a `List<LogData>` (`LogManager.LOG_LIST`) where the game pushes **one
entry per event** — stage end (success/failure), box drop, hero death/revive. The loop
in `run` reads the new entries from the **previous `size` to the current one** each tick and
decides what each one is. Each `LogData` is a managed object, so its **first field (offset 0) is the
pointer to the Il2CppClass** — the "K-class" of the log's concrete type.

**The hard rule: the event type is decided by KLASS-POINTER EQUALITY, never by a type
field.** The loop does `kl = reader.rptr(e)` (the entry's klass) and compares `kl == sc_class`,
`elif kl == sf_class`, `elif kl == gb_class`, `elif kl == die_class`, `elif kl == res_class`.
Each `*_class` is the Il2CppClass the resolver found for `StageClearLog`/`StageFailedLog`/
`GetBoxLog`/`HeroDieLog`/`ResurrectionLog`. **There is NO read of an `ELogType` field on the entry**
to label the event — the `ELogType` enum still lives in `config/offsets.py` (a catalog of the values),
but the *field* inside `LogData` was stripped from this build's IL2CPP dump, so there is no offset
to read. The `Dictionary<ELogType, List<LogData>>` (`LogManager.LOG_BY_TYPE`) is also **not used**
in the loop — only the flat `LOG_LIST`. Detecting by class type is what makes the read immune to the
missing type field.

(Detection ≠ **routing**: deciding WHICH run an event lands in belongs to the lifecycle. The real
case: a boss `GetBoxLog` is logged ~0.6s AFTER the `StageClearLog` and belongs to the PENDING
success, not to the run the close just opened — see [[invariants/run-lifecycle]], pending-close.)

## How to add a new event

1. **Resolve the class.** Put the log name in `TARGETS` (the list of classes the resolver
   scans/indexes). Without it, the resolver never learns that type's K and `kl ==` never matches.
2. **Store/validate the klass.** Pull the `*_class` from the dict of resolved classes (like
   `gb_class`/`die_class`/`res_class`); the index fast-path validates each class by a
   name round-trip before serving the K (any mismatch → falls back to the scan), so the klass that
   reaches the loop is trustworthy.
3. **Read the fields by `offsets.py` CONSTANT, never a magic number.** Define an offsets
   class (in the style of `GetBoxLog`/`HeroDieLog`/`ResurrectionLog`) and read through it — e.g. the
   box tier comes from `GetBoxLog.MONSTER_TYPE` (and maps via `BOX_KEY_BY_TIER`), the victim/killer from
   `HeroDieLog.VICTIM_HERO`/`KILLER_MONSTER`, the revived one from `ResurrectionLog.HERO`. Strings are
   name-keys `"Name_<key>"` → use the suffix parser, never `int()` on the whole string.
4. **Per-entry exception-safety.** A bad entry must **skip, not crash** the loop. The loop
   already has `if not e: continue`, and the `Reader` primitives (`rptr`/`ri32`/`read_string`)
   return `None` on unreadable memory (they never raise); the suffix parser also returns `None`
   on invalid input. Keep that contract in the new field — read defensively, handle `None`,
   and leave the whole tick covered by the `try/except` already in the loop. Garbage in an entry
   becomes a silent no-op, not a crash that kills the session.

**Changed the field? That's schema.** Adding the new entry to the run's `rec` is a shape change to
`runs.jsonl` → it requires bumping `SCHEMA_VERSION` and normalizing in the app (see the versioning note).

## metrics/events.py is COUNTING only (v1)

`metrics.events.EventFeed` is independent of the labeling loop above: it only counts **how many new
entries** appeared (delta of `size`, re-anchoring when the list truncates), without looking at any
type. It is not the event-detection path — it is a counter. **Labeling** (knowing WHICH event it is)
requires the klass-pointer, as described above; the "read each event's type" TODO in the `events.py`
header was resolved in the `run` loop precisely by klass-pointer, not by dumping the `ELogType` field.
